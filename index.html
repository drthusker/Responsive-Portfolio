		  	<p>I grew up in Nebraska City Nebraska, GBR. At 18 I joined the Army and left for Fort Jackson South Carolina. After Basic I was sent to Agusta Georgia for AIT. 
		  	Following AIT I was sent to Bad Kreuznach Germany. While in Germany I met my wife who was also in the Army and we were married in Palmyra Nebraska while on leave. 
		  	We stayed in Germany another year and a half before returning to the states.</p>
		  

		  	<p>After the military we were deciding between Nebraska City or Phoenix (her home town), it really wasn't a choice we moved to Arizona. We lived in Tempe, Chandler and Mesa before finally settling in Gilbert, AZ.
		  	 We have 4 grown childern and are becoming pretty happy with the empty nest life.</p>
